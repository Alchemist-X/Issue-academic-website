I am broadly interested in mechanism design, blockchain and AI alignment with a particular interest in incentive compatibility, DeFi and value alignment. I am currently a master student at Johns Hopkins University, focusing on Financial Econometrics. I previously earned my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from the University of Hong Kong.

My passion for academic research is fueled by my extensive experience at tech indutry and PE/VC firms. I have interned as product manager and investment analyst for several companies such as ByteDance, Hony Capital.
